# antipatterns

A FindBugs plugin for detecting misuse of inheritance and the final keyword in Java, inspired by [codingantihero]. Eliminate fragile subclassing and un-mockable APIs!

The plugin name, 'antipatterns', is aspirational: we hope to add more modern Java antipatterns in future, and would love to consider any suggestions in our [issue tracker].
